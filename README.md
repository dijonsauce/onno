<h1 align="center">McCLUCKIN' Website</h1>

[View the live project here.](https://dijonsauce.github.io/)

Welcome to McCLUCKIN', America's fastest and finest dining experience!

This is the main marketing website for McCLUCKIN'. 
It is designed to be responsive and accessible, making it easy to navigate for potential customers & partners. 

Note: The McCLUCKIN brand is a parody of fast food franchise especially KFC, Chick-Fil-A and the fictional Cluckin Bell in Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas.The Initial idea was to create a foundation for a Retail/E-commerce project that will connect from Frontend to Backend, the Fullstack during the course of the Software Development Course also as much as I like fast food, I loved the way Rockstar Game's Grand Theft Auto (GTA) portrayed fast food restaurants in the series so this project will not be as friendly as Wendy's Twitter account.

      The Menu Page hosts information and images on the current available items sold by McCLUCKIN'.

### Testing User Stories from User Experience (UX) Section

-   #### First Time Visitor Goals

    1. As a First Time Visitor, I want to easily understand the main purpose of the site and learn more about the organisation.

        1. Upon entering the site, users are automatically greeted with a clean and easily readable navigation bar to go to the page of their choice.
        2. The main points are made immediately with the hero image

    2. As a First Time Visitor, I want to be able to easily be able to navigate throughout the site to find content.

        1. The site has been designed to be fluid and never to entrap the user. At the top of each page there is a clean navigation bar, each link describes what the page they will end up at clearly.

    3. As a First Time Visitor, I want to look for testimonials to understand what their users think of them and see if they are trusted. I also want to locate their social media links to see their following on social media to determine how trusted and known they are.

        1. The user can also scroll to the bottom of any page on the site to locate social media links in the footer.

-   #### Returning Visitor Goals

    1. As a Returning Visitor, I want to find the new products and campaigns.

        1. These are clearly shown in the banner message.
        2. They will be directed to a page with another hero image and call to action.

    2. As a Returning Visitor, I want to find the best way to get in contact with the organisation with any questions I may have.

        1. The navigation bar includes a "Contact" Page.
        2. Here they can fill out the form on the page or are told that alternatively they can message the organisation on social media.
        3. The footer contains links to the organisations Facebook, Twitter and Instagram page.
        4. Whichever link they click, it will be open up in a new tab to ensure the user can easily get back to the website.

    3. As a Returning Visitor, I want to find the Facebook Group link so that I can join and interact with others in the community.
        1. The Facebook Page can be found at the footer of every page and will open a new tab for the user and more information can be found on the Facebook page.
        2. Alternatively, the user can scroll to the bottom of the Home page to find the Facebook Group redirect card and can easily join by clicking the "Join Now!" button which like any external link, will open in a new tab to ensure they can get back to the website easily.
        3. If the user is on the "Our Favourites" page they will also be greeted with a call to action button to invite the user to the Facebook group. The user is incentivized as they are told there is a weekly favourite product posted in the group.

-   #### Frequent User Goals

    1. As a Frequent User, I want to check to see if there are any new offers and meal deals.

        1. The user would already be comfortable with the website layout and can easily click the banner message.

    2. As a Frequent User, I want to check to see if there are any new posts and events.

    3. As a Frequent User, I want to follow the brand on social media so that I am notified of any major updates and/or changes to the website or organisation.
        1. At the bottom of every page there is a footer which contains the social media links.

### Testing

-   A large amount of testing was done to ensure that all pages were linking correctly.

-   Friends and colleagues were invited to review the site and documentation to point out any bugs and/or user experience issues.

-   Images not showing: from incorrecting pathway setting just using the name rather than assets/image/"name.jpg".

### Known Bugs

    -   A white gap can be seen to the right of the footer and navigation bar as a result.

-   On Microsoft Edge and Internet Explorer Browsers, all links in Navigation bar are pushed upwards when hovering over them.

### Solved Bugs
